"3","bFrameIndex","1","Number","Video frame index from a Frame 
descriptor. 
 
This field selects the video frame 
resolution from the array of resolutions 
supported by the selected stream. The 
index value ranges from 1 to the number 
of Frame descriptors following a 
particular Format descriptor. For frame-
based formats, this field must be 
supported even if only one video frame 
index is supported by the device. 
 
For video payloads with no defined 
Frame descriptor, this field shall be set to 
zero (0).  
 
This field is set by the host."

"4","dwFrameInterval","4","Number","Frame interval in 100 ns units. 
 
This field sets the desired video frame 
interval for the selected video stream and 
frame index. The frame interval value is 
specified in 100 ns units. The device 
shall support the setting of all frame 
intervals reported in the Frame

even if only one video frame interval is 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its

value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."
