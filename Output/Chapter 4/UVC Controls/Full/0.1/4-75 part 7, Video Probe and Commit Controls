"","","","","field allows the sender to indicate that it 
will identify segment boundaries in the 
stream, enabling low-latency buffer 
handling by the receiver without the 
overhead of parsing the stream itself. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, this control is set by the device, 
and is read-only from the host. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, this parameter is set by the 
host, and is read-only from the device."

"31","bPreferedVersion","1","Number","The preferred payload format version 
supported by the host or device for the 
specified bFormatIndex value. 
 
This parameter allows the host and 
device to negotiate a mutually agreed 
version of the payload format associated 
with the bFormatIndex field. The host 
initializes this and the following 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion fields 
to zero on the first Probe Set. Upon 
Probe Get, the device shall return its 
preferred version, plus the minimum and 
maximum versions supported by the 
device (see bMinVersion and 
bMaxVersion below). The host may 
issue a subsequent Probe Set/Get 
sequence to specify its preferred version 
(within the ranges returned in 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion from 
the initial Probe Set/Get sequence). The 
host is not permitted to alter the 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion values. 
 
This field will support up to 256 (1-255) 
versions of a single payload format. The 
version number is drawn from the minor 
version of the Payload Format 
specification. For example, version 1.2 of 
a Payload Format specification would 
result in a value of 2 for this parameter."
