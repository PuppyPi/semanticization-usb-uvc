The Key Frame Rate field is used to 
specify the compressorâ€™s key frame rate. 
For example, if one of every ten encoded 
frames in a video stream sequence is a 
key frame, this control would report a 
value of 10. A value of 0 indicates that 
only the first frame is a key frame.  
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The 
value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."

The P Frame Rate Control is used to 
specify the number of P frames per key 
frame. As an example of the relationship 
between the types of encoded frames, 
suppose a key frame occurs once in 
every 10 frames, and there are 3 P frames 
per key frame. The P frames will be 
spaced evenly between the key frames. 
The other 6 frames, which occur between 
the key frames and the P frames, will be 
bi-directional (B) frames."
