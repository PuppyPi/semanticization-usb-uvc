The Compression Window Size Control 
is used to specify the number of encoded 
video frames over which the average size 
cannot exceed the specified data rate. For 
a window of size n, the average frame 
size of any consecutive n frames will not 
exceed the stream's specified data rate. 
Individual frames can be larger or 
smaller.  
 
For example, if the data rate has been set 
to 100 kilobytes per second (KBps) on a 
10 frames per second (fps) movie with a 
compression window size of 10, the 
individual frames can be any size, as 
long as the average size of a frame in any 
10-frame sequence is less than or equal 
to 10 kilobytes.  
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its

supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."
