"","","","","segment size in bytes. 
 
For frame-based formats, this field 
indicates the maximum size of a single 
video frame. When streaming simulcast 
this number reflects the maximum video 
frame size of the negotiated Frame 
descriptor. For frame-based formats, this 
field must be supported. 
 
For stream-based formats, and when this 
behavior is enabled via the 
bmFramingInfo field (below), this field 
indicates the maximum size of a single 
codec-specific segment. The sender is 
required to indicate a segment boundary 
via the FID bit in the payload header. 
This field is ignored (for stream-based 
formats) if the bmFramingInfo bits are 
not enabled. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, this field is set by the device 
and read only from the host. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, this field is set by the host and 
read only from the device."
"22","dwMaxPayloadTransfer
Size","4","Number","Specifies the maximum number of bytes 
that the device can transmit or receive in 
a single payload transfer. This field must 
be supported. 
 
This field is set by the device and read 
only from the host. Some host 
implementations restrict the maximum 
value permitted for this field. The host 
shall avoid overshoot of single payload 
transfer size by reconfiguring the device. 
(e.g. by updating bitrates, resolutions 
etc.)"
"26","dwClockFrequency","4","Number","The device clock frequency in Hz for the 
specified format. This will specify the 
units used for the time information fields"
