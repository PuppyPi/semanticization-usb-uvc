"0","bLength","1","Number","","",""
	Size of this descriptor, in bytes: 7

"1","bDescriptorType","1","Constant","","",""
	ENDPOINT descriptor type

"2","bEndpointAddress","1","Endpoint","","",""
	The address of the endpoint on the USB
	device described by this descriptor. The
	address is encoded as follows:
	D7: Direction
	0 = OUT endpoint
	1 = IN endpoint
	D6..4: Reserved, reset to zero
	D3..0: The endpoint number, determined by
	the designer

"3","bmAttributes","1","Bitmap","","",""
	D1..0: Transfer type (set to 10 = Bulk)
	All other bits are reserved.

"4","wMaxPacketSize","2","Number","","",""
	Maximum packet size this endpoint is
	capable of sending or receiving when this
	configuration is selected.

"6","bInterval","1","Number","","",""
	Interval for polling endpoint for data
	transfers.
	For high-speed bulk OUT endpoints, the
	bInterval must specify the maximum NAK
	rate of the endpoint. A value of 0 indicates
	the endpoint never NAKs. Other values
	indicate at most 1 NAK each bInterval
	number of microframes. This value must be
	in the range from 0 to 255.
