"0","bLength","1","Number","","",""
	Size of this descriptor, in bytes: 7

"1","bDescriptorType","1","Constant","","",""
	ENDPOINT descriptor type

"2","bEndpointAddress","1","Endpoint","","",""
	The address of the endpoint on the USB
	device described by this descriptor. The
	address is encoded as follows:
	D7: Direction
	0 = OUT endpoint
	1 = IN endpoint
	D6..4: Reserved, reset to zero
	D3..0: The endpoint number, determined by
	the designer

"3","bmAttributes","1","Bitmap","","",""
	D3..2: Synchronization type
	01 = Asynchronous
	D1..0: Transfer type
	01 = Isochronous
	All other bits are reserved.

"4","wMaxPacketSize","2","Number","","",""
	Maximum packet size this endpoint is
	capable of sending or receiving when this
	configuration is selected.
	This is determined by the video bandwidth
	constraints of the endpoint.

"6","bInterval","1","Number","","",""
	Interval for polling endpoint for data
	transfers.
	This value is expressed as a period of frames
	or microframes depending on device speed,
	and must range from 1 to 16. The bInterval
	value is used as the exponent for a 2^(bInterval-1)
	period.
