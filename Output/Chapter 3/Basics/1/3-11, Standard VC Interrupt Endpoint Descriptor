"Offset","Field","Size","Value","Description","",""

"0","bLength","1","Number","","",""
	Size of this descriptor, in bytes: 7

"1","bDescriptorType","1","Constant","","",""
	ENDPOINT descriptor type

"2","bEndpointAddress","1","Endpoint","","",""
	The address of the endpoint on the USB
	device described by this descriptor. The
	address is encoded as follows:
	D7: Direction. 1 = IN endpoint
	D6..4: Reserved, reset to zero.
	D3..0: The endpoint number, determined by
	the designer.

"3","bmAttributes","1","Bitmap","","",""
	D3..2: Synchronization type.
	Must be set to 00 (None)
	D1..0: Transfer type.
	Must be set to 11 (Interrupt).
	All other bits are reserved, and must be set to
	zero.

"4","wMaxPacketSize","2","Number","","",""
	Maximum packet size this endpoint is
	capable of sending or receiving when this
	configuration is selected.

"6","bInterval","1","Number","","",""
	Interval for polling endpoint for data
	transfers.
	For full-speed interrupt endpoints, this value
	is expressed in frames, and must range from
	1 to 255.
	For high-speed interrupt endpoints, the
	bInterval value is used as the exponent for a
	2^(bInterval-1) value; e.g., a bInterval of 4 means
	a period of 8 (2^3). This value must be from 1
	to 16.
