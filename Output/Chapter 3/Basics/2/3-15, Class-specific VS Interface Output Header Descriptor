"Offset","Field","Size","Value","Description"

"0","bLength","1","Number"
	Size of this descriptor, in bytes: 9+(p*n)

"1","bDescriptorType","1","Constant"
	CS_INTERFACE descriptor type

"2","bDescriptorSubtype","1","Constant"
	VS_OUTPUT_HEADER descriptor
	subtype

"3","bNumFormats","1","Number"
	Number of video payload Format
	descriptors following for this interface
	(excluding video Frame descriptors): p

"4","wTotalLength","2","Number"
	Total number of bytes returned for the
	class-specific VideoStreaming interface
	descriptors including this header
	descriptor.

"6","bEndpointAddress","1","Endpoint"
	The address of the isochronous or bulk
	endpoint used for video data. The address
	is encoded as follows:
	D7: Direction
	0 = OUT endpoint
	D6..4: Reserved, set to zero
	D3..0: The endpoint number, determined
	by the designer.

"7","bTerminalLink","1","Constant"
	The terminal ID of the Input Terminal to
	which the video endpoint of this interface
	is connected.

"8","bControlSize","1","Number"
	Size of each bmaControls(x) field, in
	bytes: n

"9","bmaControls(1)","n","Bitmap"
	For bits D3..0, a bit set to 1 indicates that
	the named field is supported by the Video
	Probe and Commit Control when
	bFormatIndex is 1:
	D0: wKeyFrameRate
	D1: wPFrameRate
	D2: wCompQuality
	D3: wCompWindowSize
	
	D4..(n*8-1): Reserved, set to zero
	
	*Note* D0-D3 are deprecated. Going
	forward from version 1.5, the proper
	means to detect whether a field is
	supported by Probe & Commit is to issue
	a VS_PROBE_CONTROL(GET_CUR).
