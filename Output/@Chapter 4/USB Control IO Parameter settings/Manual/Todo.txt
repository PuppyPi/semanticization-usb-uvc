I just manually copied it into a custom form so it would fit in our Stage 2 format XD''
	+ It's just that merged cells are split simply by copying the contents into each split (sub)cell

But I also created an unused "Full/0" version to have the PDF Monkey metadata of which pages and the approximate X/Y coordinates in the page of each table for posterity :3
	(like I did with Chapter 3 for the same reason ;3 )


==2==
. Change PDF Monkey footers to just be page numbers
. Undo word-wrap in the single-line parts!
. Make sure to take care of rich text
. Remove spurious columns from the original PDF Monkey output (eg, all the "","","") so that the columns given match up with the actual tables!
. Correct any errors noticed
. Make sure escaping is done right!
+ Line endings to standard! (0x0A)


==3==
x Correct any typos you've noticed in the original material
