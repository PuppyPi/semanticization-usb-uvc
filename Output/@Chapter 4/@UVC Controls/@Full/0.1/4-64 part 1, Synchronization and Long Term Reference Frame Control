"1","wSyncFrameInte
rval","2","Number","In milliseconds. This field indicates the periodic 
recurrences of the selected bSyncFrameType. 
A value of wSyncFrameInterval = 0 indicates 
a single bSyncFrameType with no requirement 
for periodic recurrence."

"3","bGradualDecode
rRefresh","1","Number","Indicates a count of frames over which the 
gradual decoder refresh occurs. Only valid 
when bSyncFrameType = 6 (GDR). When 
bSyncFrameType is not 6, this field must be 0. 
From a recovery point of view, 
bGradualDecoderRefresh + 1 represents the 
number of frames required to completely 
refresh the picture.  
 
Bits: 
0-6: recovery_frame_cnt 
7: Reserved 
 
Use wSyncFrameInterval to establish the 
interval between Gradual Decoder Refresh 
(GDR) periods. 
When using GDR, the encoder should use 
recovery point SEI messages to indicate gradual 
decoder refresh access points."
