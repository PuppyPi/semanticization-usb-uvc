"0","bmHint","2","Bitmap","Bitfield control indicating to the function 
what fields shall be kept fixed (indicative 
only): 
D0: dwFrameInterval 
D1: wKeyFrameRate 
D2: wPFrameRate 
D3: wCompQuality 
D4: wCompWindowSize 
D15..5: Reserved (0) 
 
The hint bitmap indicates to the video 
streaming interface which fields shall be 
kept constant during stream parameter 
negotiation. For example, if the selection 
wants to favor frame rate over quality, 
the dwFrameInterval bit will be set (1). 
 
This field is set by the host, and is read-
only for the video streaming interface."

"2","bFormatIndex","1","Number","Video format index from a Format 
descriptor for this video interface. 
 
Select a specific video stream format by 
setting this field to the one-based index 
of the associated Format descriptor. To 
select the first format defined by a 
device, a value one (1) is written to this 
field. This field must be supported even 
if only one video format is supported by 
the device. 
 
This field is set by the host."

"3","bFrameIndex","1","Number","Video frame index from a Frame 
descriptor. 
 
This field selects the video frame 
resolution from the array of resolutions 
supported by the selected stream. The 
index value ranges from 1 to the number 
of Frame descriptors following a 
particular Format descriptor. For frame-
based formats, this field must be 
supported even if only one video frame 
index is supported by the device. 
 
For video payloads with no defined 
Frame descriptor, this field shall be set to 
zero (0).  
 
This field is set by the host."

"4","dwFrameInterval","4","Number","Frame interval in 100 ns units. 
 
This field sets the desired video frame 
interval for the selected video stream and 
frame index. The frame interval value is 
specified in 100 ns units. The device 
shall support the setting of all frame 
intervals reported in the Frame 
Descriptor corresponding to the selected 
Video Frame Index. For frame-based 
formats, this field must be implemented 
even if only one video frame interval is 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The 
value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."

"8","wKeyFrameRate","2","Number","Key frame rate in key-frame per video-
frame units.

This field is only applicable to sources 
(and formats) capable of streaming video 
with adjustable compression parameters. 
Use of this control is at the discretion of 
the device, and is indicated in the VS 
Input or Output Header descriptor. 
 
The Key Frame Rate field is used to 
specify the compressor’s key frame rate. 
For example, if one of every ten encoded 
frames in a video stream sequence is a 
key frame, this control would report a 
value of 10. A value of 0 indicates that 
only the first frame is a key frame.  
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The 
value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."

"10","wPFrameRate","2","Number","PFrame rate in PFrame/key frame units. 
 
This field is only applicable to sources 
(and formats) capable of streaming video 
with adjustable compression parameters. 
Use of this control is at the discretion of 
the device, and is indicated in the VS 
Input or Output Header descriptor.  
 
The P Frame Rate Control is used to 
specify the number of P frames per key 
frame. As an example of the relationship 
between the types of encoded frames, 
suppose a key frame occurs once in 
every 10 frames, and there are 3 P frames 
per key frame. The P frames will be 
spaced evenly between the key frames. 
The other 6 frames, which occur between 
the key frames and the P frames, will be 
bi-directional (B) frames.

When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The 
value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, the host shall accept the value 
indicated by the device."

"12","wCompQuality","2","Number","Compression quality control in abstract 
units 1 (lowest) to 10000 (highest). 
 
This field is only applicable to sources 
(and formats) capable of streaming video 
with adjustable compression parameters. 
Use of this field is at the discretion of the 
device, and is indicated in the VS Input 
or Output Header descriptor. 
 
This field is used to specify the quality of 
the video compression. Values for this 
property range from 1 to 10000 (1 
indicates the lowest quality, 10000 the 
highest). The resolution reported by this 
control will determine the number of 
discrete quality settings that it can 
support.  
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The 
value must be from the range of values 
supported by the device.

indicated by the device."

"14","wCompWindowSize","2","Number","Window size for average bit rate control. 
 
This field is only applicable to sources 
(and formats) capable of streaming video 
with adjustable compression parameters. 
Use of this control is at the discretion of
the device, and is indicated in the VS 
Input or Output Header descriptor.  
 
The Compression Window Size Control 
is used to specify the number of encoded 
video frames over which the average size 
cannot exceed the specified data rate. For 
a window of size 'n', the average frame 
size of any consecutive 'n' frames will not 
exceed the stream's specified data rate. 
Individual frames can be larger or 
smaller.  
 
For example, if the data rate has been set 
to 100 kilobytes per second (KBps) on a 
10 frames per second (fps) movie with a 
compression window size of 10, the 
individual frames can be any size, as 
long as the average size of a frame in any 
10-frame sequence is less than or equal 
to 10 kilobytes.  
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, the host shall indicate its 
preference during the Probe phase. The

When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, this field is set by the host and 
read only from the device."

"18","dwMaxVideoFrameSize","4","Number","Maximum video frame or codec-specific
segment size in bytes. 
 
For frame-based formats, this field 
indicates the maximum size of a single 
video frame. When streaming simulcast 
this number reflects the maximum video 
frame size of the negotiated Frame 
descriptor. For frame-based formats, this 
field must be supported. 
 
For stream-based formats, and when this 
behavior is enabled via the 
bmFramingInfo field (below), this field 
indicates the maximum size of a single 
codec-specific segment. The sender is 
required to indicate a segment boundary 
via the FID bit in the payload header. 
This field is ignored (for stream-based 
formats) if the bmFramingInfo bits are 
not enabled. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, this field is set by the device 
and read only from the host. 
 
When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, this field is set by the host and 
read only from the device."

"22","dwMaxPayloadTransfer
Size","4","Number","Specifies the maximum number of bytes 
that the device can transmit or receive in 
a single payload transfer. This field must 
be supported. 
 
This field is set by the device and read 
only from the host. Some host 
implementations restrict the maximum 
value permitted for this field. The host 
shall avoid overshoot of single payload 
transfer size by reconfiguring the device. 
(e.g. by updating bitrates, resolutions 
etc.)"

"26","dwClockFrequency","4","Number","The device clock frequency in Hz for the 
specified format. This will specify the

"30","bmFramingInfo","1","Bitmap","Bitfield control supporting the following 
values: 
 
D0:  If set to 1, the Frame ID (FID) 
field is required in the Payload 
Header (see description of D0 
in section 2.4.3.3, “Video and 
Still Image Payload Headers”). 
The sender is required to toggle 
the Frame ID at least every 
dwMaxVideoFrameSize bytes 
(see above). 
D1:  If set to 1, indicates that the End 
of Frame (EOF) field may be 
present in the Payload Header 
(see description of D1 in section 
2.4.3.3, “Video and Still Image 
Payload Headers”). It is an error 
to specify this bit without also 
specifying D0. 
D2:  If set to 1, indicates that the End 
of Slice (EOS) field may be 
present in the Payload Header. 
It is an error to specify this bit 
without also specifying D0. 
D7..3:  Reserved (0) 
 
This control indicates to the function 
whether payload transfers will contain 
out-of-band framing information in the 
Video Payload Header (see section 
2.4.3.3, “Video and Still Image Payload 
Headers”). 
 
For known frame-based formats (e.g., 
MJPEG, Uncompressed, DV), this field 
is ignored. 
 
For known stream-based formats, this
field allows the sender to indicate that it 
will identify segment boundaries in the

handling by the receiver without the 
overhead of parsing the stream itself. 
 
When used in conjunction with an IN 
endpoint, this control is set by the device,

When used in conjunction with an OUT 
endpoint, this parameter is set by the 
host, and is read-only from the device."

"31","bPreferedVersion","1","Number","The preferred payload format version 
supported by the host or device for the 
specified bFormatIndex value. 
 
This parameter allows the host and 
device to negotiate a mutually agreed 
version of the payload format associated 
with the bFormatIndex field. The host 
initializes this and the following 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion fields 
to zero on the first Probe Set. Upon 
Probe Get, the device shall return its 
preferred version, plus the minimum and 
maximum versions supported by the 
device (see bMinVersion and 
bMaxVersion below). The host may 
issue a subsequent Probe Set/Get 
sequence to specify its preferred version 
(within the ranges returned in 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion from 
the initial Probe Set/Get sequence). The 
host is not permitted to alter the 
bMinVersion and bMaxVersion values. 
 
This field will support up to 256 (1-255) 
versions of a single payload format. The 
version number is drawn from the minor 
version of the Payload Format

a Payload Format specification would 
result in a value of 2 for this parameter."

"32","bMinVersion","1","Number","The minimum payload format version 
supported by the device for the specified 
bFormatIndex value. 
 
This value is initialized to zero by the 
host and reset to a value in the range of 1

control mode for a stream of encoded 
video. If the video payload does not 
support rate control, this entire field 
should be set to 0.  
bmRateControlModes supports up to 
four simulcast streams. For simulcast 
transport the number of streams is 
inferred from the bmLayoutPerStream 
field.  Otherwise, the number of streams 
is 1.  
D3-D0: Rate-control mode for the first 
simulcast stream (with stream_id=0.)
