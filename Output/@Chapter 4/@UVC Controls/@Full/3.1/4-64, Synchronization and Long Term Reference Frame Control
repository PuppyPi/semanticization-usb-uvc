1: Generate an IDR frame for all of the
dependency layers of the current stream, if all
of the layers of the current stream have
quality_id equal to 0. Otherwise, generate key
frames for all the dependency layers.
2: Generate an IDR frame that is a long-term
reference frame for all of the dependency layers
of the current stream, if all of the layers of the
current stream have quality_id equal to 0.
Otherwise, generate a key frame for the
associated dependency layers of the current
wLayerOrViewID.
3: Generate a non-IDR random-access I frame
for the associated dependency layers of the
current wLayerOrViewID.
4: Generate a non-IDR random-access I frame
that is a long-term reference frame for the
associated dependency layers of the current
wLayerOrViewID.
5: Generate a P frame that is a-long term
reference frame for the associated dependency
layers of the current wLayerOrViewID.

"1","wSyncFrameInterval","2","Number","In milliseconds. This field indicates the periodic
recurrences of the selected bSyncFrameType.
A value of wSyncFrameInterval = 0 indicates
a single bSyncFrameType with no requirement
for periodic recurrence."
"3","bGradualDecoderRefresh","1","Number","Indicates a count of frames over which the
gradual decoder refresh occurs. Only valid
when bSyncFrameType = 6 (GDR). When
bSyncFrameType is not 6, this field must be 0.
From a recovery point of view,
bGradualDecoderRefresh + 1 represents the
number of frames required to completely
refresh the picture.

Bits:
0-6: recovery_frame_cnt
7: Reserved

Use wSyncFrameInterval to establish the
interval between Gradual Decoder Refresh
(GDR) periods.
When using GDR, the encoder should use
recovery point SEI messages to indicate gradual
decoder refresh access points."
