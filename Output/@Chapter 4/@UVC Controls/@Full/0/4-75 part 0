"0","bmHint","2","Bitmap","Bitfield control indicating to the function 
what fields shall be kept fixed (indicative 
only): 
D0: dwFrameInterval 
D1: wKeyFrameRate 
D2: wPFrameRate 
D3: wCompQuality 
D4: wCompWindowSize 
D15..5: Reserved (0) 
 
The hint bitmap indicates to the video 
streaming interface which fields shall be 
kept constant during stream parameter 
negotiation. For example, if the selection 
wants to favor frame rate over quality, 
the dwFrameInterval bit will be set (1). 
 
This field is set by the host, and is read-
only for the video streaming interface."
"2","bFormatIndex","1","Number","Video format index from a Format 
descriptor for this video interface. 
 
Select a specific video stream format by 
setting this field to the one-based index 
of the associated Format descriptor. To 
select the first format defined by a 
device, a value one (1) is written to this 
field. This field must be supported even 
if only one video format is supported by 
the device. 
 
This field is set by the host."
