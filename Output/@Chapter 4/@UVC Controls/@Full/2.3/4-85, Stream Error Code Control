1: Protected content – This situation 
occurs if the data source device detects 
that the video or still-image data is
protected and cannot be transmitted. In 
this case, empty packets containing only 
headers will be sent for the duration of 
the protected content. 
 
2: Input buffer underrun – If the data 
source device is not able to supply data at 
the requested rate, it will transmit empty 
packets containing only headers for the 
duration of the buffer underrun. 
 
3. Data discontinuity – Indicates a data 
discontinuity (arising from bad media, 
encoder errors, etc.) preceding the data 
payload in the current transfer. 
 
4: Output buffer underrun – The data sink 
device is not being supplied with data at a 
sufficient rate. 
 
5: Output buffer overrun – The data sink 
device is being supplied with data at a 
rate exceeding its buffering capabilities. 
 
6: Format change – A dynamic format 
change event occurred. See section 
2.4.3.6, ""Device Initiated Dynamic 
Format Change Support"". 
 
7: Still image capture error - An error 
occurred during still-image capture."
